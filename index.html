   The hardest thing that I have learned so far this semester but I now understand is CSS layouts. The layout is how each element appears on a page. These layouts can be manipulated through simple programming to make the page more visually appealing. Some basic commands in constructing layouts are boxes, display type, position, and floats. These elements make up the majority of CSS layouts and can easily be manipulated to change the appearance of a webpage. Boxes display type and content and include margin, border, and padding. Display type allows you to adjust the height and width of a box according to the length of the content in the box. Position determines where the text appears on the page and it has multiple types: absolute (element moves as you scroll), fixed (element does not move), and sticky (which is an elastic form of fixed position). Floats shift elements left or right on a page and other elements will follow around the float. Some types of floats include float left (elements shift from right to left) and float right (elements float from left to right). These are just some of the basic elements of CSS layouts, but I feel like this is the most complex thing I have learned so far that I feel confident in my ability to use it.

   The hardest thing I've learned that I still don't understand is the D3 algorithm. The main reason why I think I don't really understand it is because it is still a fairly new concept and there are multiple steps you must follow in a specific order to get it to function correctly. It is also difficult to me because you must write an extra function to account for possible errors with your original function. The algorithm is very specific and tedious, which gives multiple opportunities for small errors in the code that can cause the entire algorithm not to work at all. All in all, I feel like, with more practice, the D3 algorithm will begin to make more sense but right now I just feel like there are too many places to make mistakes in writing the code that will cause the entire algorithm to crash.
